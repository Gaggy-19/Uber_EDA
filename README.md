# Uber Trips Data Analysis
#### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes an Uber trip dataset to uncover travel patterns, behaviors, and insights. The dataset includes trip start and end times, miles traveled, trip purposes, and categories (Business or Personal).
The analysis was carried out in Google Colab as part of a Schoolville class project, with guidance from our facilitator and collaboration with classmates.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Explore data quality issues such as missing values and text-formatted dates.

Derive insights from ride purposes, distances, and categories.

Apply Python data analysis libraries to visualize findings.

Practice real-world data storytelling and presentation.

#### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python 3

Google Colab

Pandas â†’ Data manipulation

NumPy â†’ Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn â†’ Data visualization

#### ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Business trips dominate: The majority of rides were for meetings, errands, and customer visits.

Mixed travel behavior: Trips ranged from short 5-mile commutes to 60+ mile intercity journeys.

Messy data â‰  bad data: Missing purposes and text-based dates provided an opportunity to practice cleaning and transformation.

Visualization power: Charts revealed patterns in business vs. personal rides, trip purposes, and distance distributions.

#### ðŸ“Œ Lessons Learned

Data doesnâ€™t need to be big to tell powerful stories.

Cleaning and preprocessing are as valuable as analysis itself.

Collaboration brings multiple perspectives into data storytelling.

Tools like Google Colab make teamwork and experimentation easier.
